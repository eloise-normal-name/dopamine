## Art Brief 01: Jackpot Celebration Scene

### Prompt for Main Celebration Concept

```
A cinematic digital painting of a neon slot machine winning jackpot moment, frontal view. Three reels showing glowing JACKPOT symbols in gold. Warm golden radiant burst emanating from the reel window, not blinding but inviting. Purple gradient machine frame (hex #667eea to #764ba2) with neon accents pulsing. Magenta and cyan light streaks radiating outward. Gold sparkles cascading down like gentle fireworks. Soft volumetric light beams extending upward. Credit counter display showing dramatic number increase with motion trail. Neon night market environment visible but slightly blurred in background with deep blue-purple night sky. Retro-futuristic vaporwave aesthetic. Cozy celebratory atmosphere, not aggressive. High contrast, clean shapes, controlled glow. Digital art, polished illustration style. Aspect ratio 16:9 or 3:4 for mobile.
```

### Alternative Celebration Prompt (More Detailed)

## Art Brief 02: Neon Night Market Environment

### Prompt for Main Environment Concept

```
Wide atmospheric digital painting of an Asian-inspired neon night market at late evening. Deep blue-purple night sky (#1a1a2e to #16213e gradient). Foreground: subtle out-of-focus market stall edges and hanging lights bokeh. Midground: clean open space with warm ambient light pool from neon signs and paper lanterns - this is where slot machine will be placed. Background: night market stalls receding into depth with perspective, neon signs in magenta/cyan/purple (no readable text, abstract shapes), warm orange-yellow string lights and paper lanterns creating linear perspective, distant city skyline silhouettes. Atmospheric depth with foreground/midground/background separation. Lighting: warm neon glow (purple, magenta, cyan, gold), soft orange lantern fill light, cool blue-purple night atmosphere. Subtle steam or light fog for atmosphere. Reflections on wet pavement optional. Vaporwave meets traditional Asian night market aesthetic. Cozy urban night warmth mood. 2560x1440 landscape or 1920x1080. Layered depth for parallax scrolling.
```

### Alternative Environment Prompt (Simplified)

```
Neon night market background illustration, late evening atmosphere. Layer 1 (deep background): dark blue-purple night sky with subtle stars. Layer 2 (far background): distant market stalls and city structures in silhouette, purple-blue tones. Layer 3 (midground): illuminated market area with neon signs (abstract, no text), warm paper lanterns, string lights creating depth. Clean central area for game placement with warm ambient glow. Layer 4 (foreground): bokeh lights and subtle framing elements, out of focus. Color palette: deep night blues and purples, bright neon accents (cyan #06b6d4, magenta #ec4899, purple #667eea), warm lantern orange/yellow (#ffd700, #f59e0b). Style: stylized digital painting with atmospheric depth. Mood: cozy, inviting, peaceful nightlife energy. Separate layers for parallax effect.
```

### Prompt for Neon Sign Detail Studies

```
Reference sheet of Asian-inspired neon sign designs for night market. 6-8 individual neon signs in different abstract shapes: geometric patterns, curved forms, stylized symbols (no readable text or brand names). Each sign glowing in single color: cyan, magenta, purple, gold, or orange. Show neon tube glass glow with soft falloff, mounting hardware, subtle reflections. Technical illustration style on dark background for easy extraction. Retro-futuristic vaporwave aesthetic. Individual sign dimensions roughly 200-400px for modular use. Separate elements for layered scene composition.

## Generation Tips

### For DALL-E 3
- Use aspect ratio 1024x1024 (square), 1792x1024 (landscape), or 1024x1792 (portrait)
- Request "high detail" or "professional illustration quality"
- Be specific about style: "digital painting," "technical illustration," "concept art"

### For Midjourney
- Add style parameters: `--style raw` for more literal interpretation
- Use aspect ratio flag: `--ar 16:9` or `--ar 3:4` as needed
- Add quality flag: `--q 2` for higher quality
- Consider `--stylize` value for artistic interpretation level

### For Stable Diffusion
- Use model: Stable Diffusion XL or specialized illustration models
- Negative prompt: "photorealistic, 3D render, low quality, blurry, text, watermark, aggressive, harsh lighting, chaotic"
- Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras or Euler A
- Steps: 30-50 for quality
- CFG Scale: 7-9 for style adherence

### General Tips
- Generate multiple variations and select best
- Use generated images as starting point for artist refinement
- Maintain consistent style across all three art briefs
- Save high-resolution versions for detail work
- Document which prompts generated which images

## Post-Generation Workflow

1. **Review Generated Images**
   - Check alignment with art brief specifications
   - Verify color palette matches hex codes
   - Ensure mood and atmosphere are correct

2. **Refine if Needed**
   - Iterate prompts based on initial results
   - Adjust style keywords for better matching
   - Generate variations with different seeds

3. **Save to Proper Directories**
   - Celebration concepts → `celebration/`
   - Environment concepts → `environment/`
   - Machine details → `machine-details/`
   - Use naming convention: `[type]-[description]-ai-gen-v01.png`

4. **Document Generation**
   - Note which tool and prompt was used
   - Save generation parameters for reproducibility
   - Update category README with image status

5. **Artist Handoff**
   - Use AI-generated concepts as reference
   - Have artist refine and polish for production quality
   - Extract final assets from refined artwork

## Color Palette Quick Reference

For consistency across all generated images:

**Primary:**
- Purple gradient: `#667eea` → `#764ba2`
- Deep night: `#1a1a2e` → `#16213e`

**Neon accents:**
- Cyan: `#06b6d4`
- Magenta: `#ec4899`
- Gold: `#ffd700`

**Additional:**
- Orange: `#f59e0b`
- Silver-blue: `#9ca3af` with blue tint
- Cherry red: `#dc2626`

Include these hex codes in prompts or post-process to match exactly.
