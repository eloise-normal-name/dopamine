# Slot Machine Art Briefs

Three creative directions for "Neon Night Market Slots" visual development. Each brief pairs an emotional target with enough technical detail to guide production.

## Brief 01: Jackpot Celebration Scene

### Emotional Target
**"Triumphant but cozy"** — The feeling of opening the perfect gift. Winning should fill the screen with warmth, not assault the viewer with flashing lights. Think: a room slowly flooding with golden light while sparks drift lazily upward.

### What to Depict
- A slot machine mid-celebration: symbols aligned, light radiating outward
- Gold and warm-colored particles drifting and spiraling
- The reel window glowing from within, casting light onto the surrounding frame
- A sense of contained energy — powerful but not explosive

### Composition
- **Center focus**: The winning symbol line draws the eye
- **Radial energy**: Light and particles spread outward from the win
- **Warm periphery**: Ambient glow softens the edges of the scene

### Technical Specs
- **Dimensions**: 1920×1080 (16:9 landscape)
- **Key colors**: Gold `#ffd700`, warm amber, soft white highlights
- **Accent colors**: Purple `#764ba2` for depth, cyan `#06b6d4` for sparkle
- **Performance note**: Celebration effects will layer over the base game — design for compositing

### Reference Context
- Disney's "warm glow" celebration style (contained, inviting)
- Candy Crush's win animations (readable, satisfying, not overwhelming)
- Fireside warmth lighting studies

## Brief 02: Neon Night Market Environment

### Emotional Target
**"Cozy urban night warmth"** — Finding your favorite late-night spot. The environment should feel like somewhere you'd want to linger — warm neon light, interesting depth, a sense of place. Not a generic city backdrop but a *specific* place with character.

### What to Depict
- A nighttime urban market scene with layered depth
- Multiple sources of neon light in warm and cool tones
- Atmospheric depth: foreground details, midground activity, background skyline
- Signs, stalls, ambient life that suggests a world beyond the frame

### Composition
- **Layered depth**: Minimum 3 distinct planes for parallax potential
- **Light sources**: Multiple colored neon signs creating overlapping pools of light
- **Atmospheric haze**: Subtle depth fog to separate layers
- **Point of interest**: A central area that naturally frames where the slot machine would sit

### Technical Specs
- **Dimensions**: 2560×1440 (16:9, oversized for parallax panning)
- **Layer structure**: Background (sky/buildings), midground (market activity), foreground (close elements)
- **Key colors**: Deep blue-purple `#1a1a2e` base, warm neon accents
- **Parallax note**: Each depth layer should be separable for independent scrolling

### Reference Context
- Blade Runner's neon-lit urban environments (depth, atmosphere, warmth)
- Japanese yokocho (alleyway restaurant rows) — intimate, glowing, inviting
- Vaporwave aesthetics — retro-modern color treatment
- Night market photography from Taipei, Bangkok, Hong Kong

## Brief 03: Machine Component Close-ups

### Emotional Target
**"Precision meets personality"** — The machine should feel like a premium object. Materials communicate quality — brushed metal catches light, glass has depth, buttons have satisfying weight. Technical details should feel beautiful, not clinical.

### What to Depict
A series of close-up studies:

1. **The Reel Window** — The central viewport where symbols appear. Slightly rounded glass with subtle reflections, warm backlighting, a sense of depth beyond the surface.

2. **The Cabinet Frame** — Overall machine form. Art deco or retro-modern curves, chrome or brushed metal accents, neon edge lighting.

3. **Controls & Buttons** — Physical interaction points. Buttons with satisfying shape and material, displays that glow with warmth, levers or controls with mechanical character.

4. **Material Studies** — Close crops of surfaces: metal grain, glass transparency, glowing edge details, neon tube cross-sections.

### Composition
- **Tight framing**: Fill the frame with the subject
- **Dramatic lighting**: Neon edge-lighting reveals form and material
- **Selective focus**: Sharp subject, softly glowing background

### Technical Specs
- **Dimensions**: Various (1:1 for studies, 4:3 for component views)
- **Key materials**: Brushed metal (silver-blue), warm glass, chrome, glowing neon tube
- **Color treatment**: Purple-blue ambient with warm accent lighting
- **Detail level**: High enough to extract individual elements for sprites

### Reference Context
- High-end audio equipment photography (materials, craft, premium feel)
- Art deco architecture details (curves, chrome, geometric patterns)
- Pinball machine close-ups (glass, metal, light interaction)
- Mechanical watch photography (precision, beauty in engineering)
