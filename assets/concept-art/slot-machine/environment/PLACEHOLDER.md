# Placeholder — Environment Concepts

No concept art has been generated yet.

## Expected Contents

After concept generation, this directory will contain AI-generated images exploring:

- **Full scene compositions** — Complete night market environments with layered depth
- **Layer separations** — Individual background, midground, and foreground elements for parallax
- **Atmospheric studies** — Neon light, steam, rain reflections, depth haze
- **Neon sign character studies** — Individual signs with personality and color
- **Color mood studies** — Abstract explorations of the night market palette

## Technical Reference

- Target resolution: 2560×1440 (oversized for parallax scrolling)
- Layer structure: Background sky/buildings, midground market, foreground details
- Primary palette: Deep blue-purple `#1a1a2e`, warm neon accents (pink, cyan, orange)
- Parallax: Each depth layer should be extractable as a separate element
- Atmospheric depth: Subtle haze/fog to reinforce layer separation

## How to Contribute

1. Read the prompts in `../AI_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md` (Direction 02)
2. Generate concepts using DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
3. Save results here using the naming convention: `slot-environment-<desc>-v<##>.png`
4. Delete this PLACEHOLDER file once real concepts exist
