# Environment Concept Art

This directory contains concept art for the "Neon Night Market" environment and atmospheric backgrounds.

## Purpose
Visual development for the slot machine's setting, establishing mood, depth, and world context.

## Art Brief
See parent directory: `../README.md` → Art Brief 02: Neon Night Market Environment

## Concepts Needed

### Primary Concept: Neon Night Market Background
- [ ] Composition sketches (multiple layout options)
- [ ] Refined environment concept (full scene)
- [ ] Depth layer breakdown (foreground/mid/background separated)
- [ ] Lighting study (neon glow distribution and intensity)
- [ ] Color mood study (night atmosphere variations)

### Supporting Concepts
- [ ] Market stall details (close-up studies)
- [ ] Neon sign designs (individual sign concepts)
- [ ] Lantern and string light patterns
- [ ] Atmospheric effects (fog, steam, ambient particles)
- [ ] Skyline/distant city silhouettes
- [ ] Foreground framing elements

## Variations to Explore

- [ ] **Time variant 01**: Deep night (darkest)
- [ ] **Time variant 02**: Late evening (baseline)
- [ ] **Time variant 03**: Pre-dawn (subtle light shift)
- [ ] **Density variant 01**: Busy market (many elements)
- [ ] **Density variant 02**: Quiet market (minimal)
- [ ] **Detail level 01**: Full detail (desktop)
- [ ] **Detail level 02**: Simplified (mobile)
- [ ] **Detail level 03**: Minimal (reduced motion)

## Layer Structure for Final Concept

When creating the layered final:
1. **Sky** - Deep blue-purple night sky
2. **Far background** - Distant city/structures
3. **Background market** - Distant stalls and depth
4. **Midground** - Main market area (machine placement zone)
5. **Foreground** - Framing elements (bokeh, near details)
6. **Lighting overlay** - Glow, neon light effects
7. **Atmosphere** - Fog, steam, ambient particles

## Implementation Assets

From approved concepts, extract:
- Background layer sprites (static or parallax layers)
- Neon sign SVGs or sprites
- Lighting overlay effects
- Atmospheric particle systems
- Color grading LUT or palette
- Ambient animation references

## Technical Considerations

- **Parallax scrolling**: Prepare layers at different scroll speeds
- **Performance**: High-detail vs simplified versions
- **Responsive**: Works at different aspect ratios (16:9, 9:16, 4:3)
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion version planning

## Status

- [ ] Composition sketches created
- [ ] Refined concept completed
- [ ] Layer separation documented
- [ ] Variations explored
- [ ] Concept approved
- [ ] Assets enumerated
- [ ] Ready for production
