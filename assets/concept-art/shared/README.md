# Shared Concept Art

Visual development for reusable elements that maintain consistency across all Dopamine games.

## What Goes Here

Concepts for UI components, visual effects, and design language that aren't specific to a single game. These elements form the "Dopamine look" — the shared visual vocabulary that ties the collection together.

## Planned Categories

### UI Components
- [ ] Button designs (primary action, secondary, states)
- [ ] Counter/display treatments (credits, scores, timers)
- [ ] Navigation elements (game switcher, settings, headers)
- [ ] Modal and overlay styles
- [ ] Info panels and tooltips

### Visual Effects
- [ ] Particle systems (celebration, ambient, reward, transition)
- [ ] Glow treatments (soft, medium, intense, pulsing)
- [ ] Transition animations (page changes, state changes)
- [ ] Loading/thinking indicators

### Typography
- [ ] Display heading styles (game titles, big wins)
- [ ] Body text treatments
- [ ] Numeric display styles (counters, scores)

### Color & Material Language
- [ ] Purple gradient applications
- [ ] Neon accent usage patterns
- [ ] Glass and metal material treatments
- [ ] Dark background variations

## Design DNA

All shared elements should feel:
- **Cohesive** — Obviously part of the same family
- **Warm** — Controlled glow, inviting colors
- **Readable** — Clear at small sizes and at a glance
- **Premium** — Quality materials and careful craft

## Status

⏳ To be developed after game-specific concepts establish the visual vocabulary.
