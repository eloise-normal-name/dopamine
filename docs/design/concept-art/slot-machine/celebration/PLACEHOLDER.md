# Placeholder — Celebration Concepts

No concept art has been generated yet.

## Expected Contents

After concept generation, this directory will contain AI-generated images exploring:

- **Win glow studies** — How golden light fills the scene during a win
- **Particle choreography** — Patterns and behaviors of celebration particles
- **Reward intensity tiers** — Visual escalation from small win to jackpot
- **Color and light studies** — Abstract explorations of the celebration palette

## Technical Reference

- Target resolution: 1920×1080
- Primary palette: Gold `#ffd700`, amber, warm white, purple shadows
- Must composite cleanly over the base game layer
- Animation reference: 1.5-3 second celebration sequences

## How to Contribute

1. Read the prompts in `../AI_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md` (Direction 01)
2. Generate concepts using DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
3. Save results here using the naming convention: `slot-celebration-<desc>-v<##>.png`
4. Delete this PLACEHOLDER file once real concepts exist
