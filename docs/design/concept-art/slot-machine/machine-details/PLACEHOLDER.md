# Placeholder — Machine Detail Concepts

No concept art has been generated yet.

## Expected Contents

After concept generation, this directory will contain AI-generated images exploring:

- **Reel window studies** — The central viewport as a "portal" with glass depth and edge lighting
- **Cabinet form studies** — Overall machine shape, proportions, and style direction
- **Button and control designs** — Interactive elements with satisfying shape and material
- **Display studies** — Credit counters, win displays, and numeric typography
- **Material close-ups** — Brushed metal, warm glass, chrome, neon tube textures
- **Exploded/deconstructed views** — Structural anatomy of the machine as art

## Technical Reference

- Dimensions: Various (1:1 for material studies, 4:3 for component views)
- Key materials: Brushed aluminum, tinted glass, chrome, glowing neon
- Color treatment: Purple-blue ambient with warm accent lighting
- Detail level: High enough to extract individual elements for game sprites

## How to Contribute

1. Read the prompts in `../AI_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md` (Direction 03)
2. Generate concepts using DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
3. Save results here using the naming convention: `slot-detail-<desc>-v<##>.png`
4. Delete this PLACEHOLDER file once real concepts exist
