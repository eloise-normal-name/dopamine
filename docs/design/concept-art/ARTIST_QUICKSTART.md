# Artist Quickstart

Get from zero to concept art in five minutes.

## What You're Making

Visual concepts for **"Neon Night Market Slots"** — a cozy, neon-lit slot machine game that feels like finding your favorite late-night arcade. Think vaporwave-meets-retro-arcade: purple gradients, warm neon glow, satisfying mechanical rhythm.

## The Prompt-Based Method

Instead of drawing from scratch, you'll:

1. **Read a creative prompt** from our prompt library
2. **Feed it to an AI image tool** (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
3. **Generate several variations** — run it 5-10 times
4. **Pick the ones that feel right** — trust your gut
5. **Iterate** — tweak the prompt, regenerate, refine

The prompts are written to be evocative and open-ended. They describe moods and feelings, not pixel-perfect specifications. This is intentional — we want the AI to surprise us.

## Your First Five Minutes

1. Open [`slot-machine/AI_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md`](slot-machine/AI_IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md)
2. Scroll to **Direction 02: Neon Night Market Environment** (best starting point)
3. Copy the "Living Night Market" prompt
4. Paste it into your AI image tool
5. Generate 4-5 variations
6. Save anything that sparks joy in `slot-machine/environment/`

That's it. You're doing concept art.

## Three Directions to Explore

### 🎆 Direction 01: Celebration (Priority: Medium)
*What winning feels like as pure light and color*

The moment of payoff — gold glow, particles, warmth. Should feel "triumphant but cozy," like opening the perfect gift. Not aggressive fireworks — more like a room filling with warm light.

→ Prompts: "The Moment of Triumph", "Particle Symphony", "The Jackpot Glow"

### 🌃 Direction 02: Environment (Priority: HIGH — Start Here)
*The world the game lives in*

A neon night market at that perfect hour — warm, glowing, inviting. Layered depth (foreground stalls, midground activity, background skyline). The kind of place you'd want to stay all night.

→ Prompts: "The Living Night Market", "Neon Dreamscape Layers", "Midnight Mood Study", "Neon Sign Collection"

### 🎰 Direction 03: Machine Details (Priority: Lower)
*Premium craftsmanship up close*

The slot machine cabinet, reel window, buttons, displays. Materials that communicate quality — brushed metal, warm glass, glowing edges. Where engineering becomes art.

→ Prompts: "Portal to Possibility", "The Cabinet", "Mechanical Poetry", "Numbers That Dance", "Material Essence", "Deconstructed Beauty"

## Color Palette

These colors inform your work but don't restrict it:

**Primary**: Purple gradient `#667eea` → `#764ba2`
**Depth**: Night blue `#1a1a2e` to `#16213e`
**Accents**: Cyan `#06b6d4` · Magenta `#ec4899` · Gold `#ffd700`

## What "Good" Looks Like

A successful concept:
- ✅ Makes you feel something (cozy? excited? curious?)
- ✅ Captures the "neon night market" mood
- ✅ Could inspire specific game assets
- ✅ Surprises you in a good way

A concept doesn't need to be:
- ❌ Technically precise
- ❌ Production-ready
- ❌ Exactly what anyone expected

## Workflow for a Full Exploration

**Days 1-2**: Pick a direction, generate 15+ variations, save everything interesting
**Days 3-4**: Narrow to 3-5 favorites, refine prompts based on what worked, generate focused variations
**Day 5**: Select 1-2 strongest concepts, document what makes them work

Then move to the next direction (Environment → Celebration → Machine Details).

## AI Tool Tips

**DALL-E**: Interprets descriptive language well. Write prompts like you're telling a story.
**Midjourney**: Strong artistic interpretation. Use `--stylize` for more creative latitude. Embrace unexpected results.
**Stable Diffusion**: Fine control available. Use negative prompts to steer away from unwanted elements without over-constraining.
