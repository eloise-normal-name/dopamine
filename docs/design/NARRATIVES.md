# Game Narratives & Descriptions

This document provides colorful, narrative descriptions for each game in Dopamine. These descriptions establish the personality and experience of each game before development begins.

> **Priority**: These narratives should be finalized before content development. They guide visual design, audio direction, and implementation decisions.

## Purpose

- **Set the tone** - Establish mood and personality before coding
- **Guide design** - Visual and audio teams use these as creative briefs
- **Maintain coherence** - Ensure all games feel like part of Dopamine
- **Inspire development** - Give developers context for their work

## Writing Guidelines

Each game narrative should include:
1. **Evocative description** - What does it feel like to watch?
2. **Visual mood** - Colors, movement, energy level
3. **Audio personality** - Sound character and music style
4. **Emotional goal** - What feeling should viewers experience?
5. **Key moments** - Highlight the most satisfying parts

## 🎰 Slot Machine: "Lucky Sevens"

> Iteration kickoff doc: [visual/SLOT_MACHINE_ITERATION_01.md](visual/SLOT_MACHINE_ITERATION_01.md)

### The Experience

**Watch the reels dance.** Three gleaming slots spin in unison, a blur of bright fruits and lucky symbols. The anticipation builds as each reel slows—*click... click... click*—settling one by one into place. Cherry. Lemon. Seven. 

Sometimes they match. Sometimes they don't. But there's something hypnotic about the rhythm: the spin, the slow-down, the reveal. Credits tick up and down like a heartbeat. The machine never gets tired, never gets bored. It just... keeps... spinning.

### Visual Mood

**Bright, nostalgic, mechanical**
- **Palette**: Classic slot symbols in saturated colors - red cherries, yellow lemons, orange oranges, lucky sevens in silver-blue
- **Movement**: Smooth vertical scrolling with believable deceleration
- **Energy**: Medium-high - exciting but not frantic
- **Lighting**: Subtle glow around winning combinations, pulsing highlights on reels

**Key Visual Moments**:
- The initial spin blur (all reels moving in perfect sync)
- Each reel settling (satisfying *thunk* feeling)
- Win celebration (symbols pulse, glow, maybe a little confetti burst)
- Credit counter updating (smooth number transitions)

### Audio Personality

**Mechanical, satisfying, vintage arcade**
- **Spin sound**: Mechanical whir, possibly with subtle digital texture
- **Stop sounds**: Distinct *click* for each reel (different pitches?)
- **Win sounds**: Escalating - small win (pleasant chime), medium win (cascade of notes), big win (triumphant fanfare)
- **Background**: Subtle ambient casino atmosphere OR nothing (let player focus)

### Emotional Goal

**Anticipation and resolution.** The pleasure of wondering "will this one match?" followed by the instant answer. Like popping bubble wrap or peeling a sticker cleanly - simple, satisfying, endlessly repeatable.

Viewers should feel: **Relaxed alertness.** Calm enough to be meditative, engaging enough to hold attention.

## 🎁 Gacha: "Capsule Dreams"

### The Experience

**What's inside the mystery capsule?** A colorful machine looms before you, filled with rainbow orbs of varying sizes and brightness. Watch as a capsule tumbles down the track, bouncing and rolling with playful physics. It lands with a satisfying *thunk* in the collection tray.

The capsule splits open with a pop—what will it be? Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary? Each prize glows with its own aura. Some are humble. Some are extraordinary. The machine never runs out. There's always another capsule waiting to drop.

### Visual Mood

**Playful, colorful, theatrical**
- **Palette**: Rainbow spectrum - common items in soft pastels, rare items in vibrant jewel tones, legendaries in iridescent golds and holographic effects
- **Movement**: Bouncy physics (capsules should feel weighty but playful), dramatic reveal animations
- **Energy**: High during reveal, calm during anticipation
- **Lighting**: Aura/glow effects based on rarity, sparkles and particles for higher tiers

**Key Visual Moments**:
- Capsule selection (highlighting random capsule before it drops)
- The tumble (satisfying physics-based movement)
- The crack-open moment (brief pause, then *pop!*)
- Reveal animation (item emerges with rarity-appropriate fanfare)
- Collection update (new item added to visible collection)

### Audio Personality

**Whimsical, surprising, rewarding**
- **Selection sound**: Mechanical *clunk* or glass *tink*
- **Tumble sounds**: Bouncing, rolling physics sounds

  - Rare: Shimmering cascade
  - Epic: Magical sparkle with deeper notes
  - Legendary: Full triumphant jingle with choir or bells
- **Background**: Upbeat, playful carnival/toy shop music

### Emotional Goal

**Surprise and delight.** The joy of opening presents, the thrill of "what if it's something special?" Even common items should feel charming. Legendary items should feel genuinely exciting.

Viewers should feel: **Childlike wonder.** Like watching someone open birthday presents—you're excited for them even though it's not yours.

## 🎲 Dice Roll: "Probability Garden"

### The Experience

**Watch chaos bloom into patterns.** Dice tumble endlessly across a clean table, their faces catching light as they spin. Each roll is random, but over time, beautiful patterns emerge. Six appears more often than you'd expect—or does it? Is that a streak of doubles? The numbers dance, and probability reveals itself through pure repetition.

Optional visualizations grow alongside: bar graphs rise and fall, heatmaps shift color, probability curves trace themselves in the air. The dice don't care about math—they just keep rolling—but the patterns... the patterns are mesmerizing.

### Visual Mood

**Clean, analytical, hypnotic**
- **Palette**: Dice in clean white or subtle color tints, numbers in high-contrast black. Data visualizations in gradient spectrum (cool blues fading to warm oranges)
- **Movement**: Realistic dice physics with satisfying tumbles, smooth data animation updates
- **Energy**: Medium-low - contemplative rather than exciting
- **Lighting**: Clean, even lighting with subtle shadows for depth

**Key Visual Moments**:
- Dice release (multiple dice tumbling at once)
- Mid-roll (spinning, bouncing chaos)
- Settle and reveal (dice come to rest, numbers facing up)
- Pattern visualization update (bars grow, colors shift)
- Notable events (all sixes! streak of evens! highlighted visually)

### Audio Personality

**Crisp, mathematical, zen**
- **Dice sounds**: Realistic plastic clatter and rolling
- **Settle sound**: Soft *thunk* as dice stop moving
- **Number reveal**: Subtle *tick* or none (let visuals speak)
- **Milestone sounds**: Special events (streak, rare combo) get gentle chime
- **Background**: Minimal - perhaps soft ambient drone or silence

### Emotional Goal

**Meditative observation.** The pleasure of watching randomness resolve, of seeing order emerge from chaos. Like watching rain on a window or waves on a shore—naturally occurring patterns that soothe the mind.

Viewers should feel: **Calm curiosity.** Present and engaged but not stressed. The mathematical beauty should be accessible, not intimidating.

## 🃏 Card Flip: "Memory Palace"

### The Experience

**A grid of cards waits, face-down and patient.** One by one, they flip to reveal colorful symbols: stars, hearts, moons, flowers. The game seeks matches on its own, flipping two cards at a time with perfect memory. Sometimes it finds a pair immediately—*match!* The cards shimmer and fade away. Sometimes it reveals two different symbols, and they flip back down, mysterious once more.

The grid slowly empties as pairs are found. The rhythm is calming: flip, flip, pause. Match or no match. Flip, flip, pause. Until finally, the last pair is revealed and the board is clear. Then it begins again with a fresh shuffle.

### Visual Mood

**Gentle, organized, satisfying**
- **Palette**: Soft pastels for card backs, bright but harmonious colors for symbols. Clean white space between cards.
- **Movement**: Smooth card flip animations (3D rotation), gentle fade-out for matched pairs
- **Energy**: Low-medium - peaceful and methodical
- **Lighting**: Soft highlights on flipped cards, subtle glow on matched pairs

**Key Visual Moments**:
- Card flip (smooth 180° rotation revealing symbol)
- Non-match (both cards flip back, maybe slight shake or fade)
- Match found (cards pulse, glow, then fade away together)
- Empty space (grid reorganizes or stays sparse)
- Board complete (brief celebration, then reset)

### Audio Personality

**Soft, clear, rewarding**
- **Flip sound**: Gentle *whoosh* or card shuffle
- **No match**: Soft *tink* or gentle negative tone
- **Match sound**: Pleasant chime, notes harmonize for pair
- **Clear board**: Satisfying completion sound
- **Background**: Soft, minimal music or silence

### Emotional Goal

**Order and completion.** The satisfaction of organization, of perfect memory, of tidying up. Like arranging a bookshelf or completing a puzzle—peaceful productivity.

Viewers should feel: **Gentle accomplishment.** Satisfied with each match, pleased with each completed board. Calm but not bored.

## Writing New Game Narratives

### Template

When adding a new game, create a narrative following this structure:

**Game Name: "Memorable Subtitle"**

**The Experience** (2-3 paragraphs)
- What do you see and feel when watching?
- What's the core loop?
- What makes it satisfying?

**Visual Mood** (bulleted list + key moments)
- Palette
- Movement
- Energy level
- Lighting effects
- 3-5 key visual moments

**Audio Personality** (bulleted list)
- Sound character description
- Specific sounds for actions
- Background/music approach

**Emotional Goal** (1 paragraph + summary)
- What feeling are we targeting?
- How should viewers feel while watching?
- One-sentence emotional summary

### Review Process

Before development:
1. Write narrative and share with team
2. Iterate based on feedback (does it fit Dopamine?)
3. Create mood board from narrative
4. Begin visual/audio concepting
5. Only then start implementation

Narrative → Design → Development (in that order!)

## Maintaining Coherence

### The Dopamine Feel

All games should share these qualities:
- **Watchable** - Interesting to observe passively
- **Satisfying** - Moments of resolution and completion
- **Colorful** - Vibrant but not overwhelming
- **Polished** - Smooth animations, good sound design
- **Simple** - Complex enough to be interesting, simple enough to understand immediately

### Visual Coherence
- Purple gradient theme appears somewhere (UI, accents, or background)
- Consistent animation timing (60fps, similar easing functions)
- Similar levels of detail (not photo-realistic, not overly minimalist)

### Audio Coherence
- Similar quality/fidelity across games
- Non-intrusive volume levels
- Optional/mutable
- Positive, pleasant tones (avoid harsh or alarming sounds)

### Tonal Coherence
- Playful but not childish
- Calming but not boring
- Rewarding but not manipulative
- Fun but not chaotic

## Using These Narratives

**For Designers**: Use as creative brief for mockups and concepting
**For Developers**: Reference for implementation priorities and polish
**For Audio**: Guide for sound character and music direction
**For Writers**: Basis for help text, marketing copy, game descriptions

These narratives are living documents—update them as games evolve, but always maintain the core emotional goal.
