# Gacha Game

A capsule toy/loot box simulation that plays automatically.

## Status
🚧 Coming Soon

## Planned Features

- Auto-pull every few seconds
- Multiple rarity tiers (Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- Collection tracking
- Duplicate system
- Visual capsule opening animation
- Particle effects
- Sound effects
- Pity system (guaranteed rare after X pulls)

## Concept

Players watch as the game automatically opens virtual loot boxes, revealing items of varying rarity. The game maintains a collection and shows statistics about pulls.

## Rarity Distribution (Planned)

| Rarity | Probability | Visual |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Common | 60% | Gray |
| Rare | 30% | Blue |
| Epic | 9% | Purple |
| Legendary | 1% | Gold |

## Implementation Notes

This will be implemented after the slot machine is complete. It will follow the same architecture pattern and reuse shared utilities.
